# Hackathon Project - NeuroDefend-[AI Defending AI]

# 🛡️ NeuroDefend – AI-Based Cybersecurity Suite

NeuroDefend is a cutting-edge AI-powered cybersecurity suite designed to proactively detect, analyze, and mitigate cyber threats in real time. Built by a passionate team of undergraduate engineers, this project combines artificial intelligence with threat intelligence to provide smart and interactive defense mechanisms.

## 🔍 Overview

The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks demands intelligent and automated defense systems. NeuroDefend is built to cater to this need through three integrated AI modules:

- **PromptShield** – Real-time prompt injection threat detection using NLP.
- **SentinelHawk** – Malicious script detection using AI-based classification.
- **ThreatCostAI** – Calculates risk level and potential financial damage of threats.

All modules are integrated into a **single Streamlit dashboard** for simplicity and interactivity.

## 🧠 Modules
### 🔐 Module 1: PromptShield
Detects and flags potentially harmful prompt injection attacks using large language model-based analysis and pattern matching.

### 🕵️ Module 2: SentinelHawk
Analyzes code/scripts (JavaScript, Python, etc.) and classifies them as malicious or benign using supervised machine learning algorithms.

### 💰 Module 3: ThreatCostAI
Calculates the **risk score** and **financial impact** of each threat using historical data, severity level, and impact modeling techniques.

## 🚀 Features
